## [3.1.138]

### Added

- Added [Contexts](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/java/enriching-events/context/)
  to the initialisation of Sentry so that additional information can
  be sent upon each event. Further information contained within the
  README.md and in `sentry_clj/core.clj`. **Note:** `:extras` has been
  deprecated by Sentry - use `:contexts` instead.

## [3.1.137]

- Bump up ring-core to 1.8.2

## [3.1.135]

### Added

- Added in `before-send-fn` and `before-breadcrumb-fn` to the
  initialisation map. This allows for events or breadcrumbs to be
  mutated before sending off to Sentry (or indeed to *prevent* sending
  to Sentry if the respective functions returns nil)

## [3.1.134]

### Changed

- Don't default the environment to "production" if none if found on
  the event, let the Java library do that now.

- Updated pom.xml with some additional metadata information.
- Bumped Sentry Java to 3.1.1.

## [3.1.0]

### Added

- Added in the ability to define the Environment on configuration of
  Sentry (and not only per-event!)
- Added in the ability to disable the built-in
  UncaughtExceptionHandler in order to allow defining our own.
- Added in a couple of examples:
  - A basic example showing how to register a sentry-logger and how to
    fire an event.
  - An example that registers it's own uncaught exception handler to
    not only log out to sentry, but also to log out to a
    pre-configured logger.

### Changed

- Major release bringing compatibility with version 3.1.0 of the Java
  Sentry library. This is a **BREAKING** change, insofar that this has
  only been tested with the latest Sentry (20.9.0) and is **not**
  compatible with Sentry 10.0.1 and below. If you wish to use those
  versions, please continue to use sentry-clj 1.7.30.
